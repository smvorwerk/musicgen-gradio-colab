    ### More details

    The model will generate 12 seconds of audio based on the description you provided.
    You can optionaly provide a reference audio from which a broad melody will be extracted.
    The model will then try to follow both the description and melody provided.
    All samples are generated with the `melody` model.
  
    You can also use your own GPU or a Google Colab by following the instructions on our repo.

    See [github.com/facebookresearch/audiocraft](https://github.com/facebookresearch/audiocraft)
    for more details.
